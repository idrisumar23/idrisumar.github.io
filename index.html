<section id="Research Expertise">
	<h2>Research Expertise</h2>
	<ul>
I specialize in Medicinal Chemistry with a focus on the discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents (APIs). My research involves the design, synthesis, and optimization of bioactive small molecules to address unmet medical needs. I integrate structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, molecular modeling, docking Studies and advanced synthetic methodologies to enhance drug efficacy, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties. My work also emphasizes multidisciplinary collaboration, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as high-throughput screening, computational chemistry, and biological assays to accelerate the drug discovery process.
My expertise extends to areas such as Natual Products Phytochemicals, extraction, Isolation and Characterization of Molecules with anticancer properties and many other diseases using bioactivity guided Column fractionation and spectroscopic techniques as well as hit-to-lead , target-based drug design, and the development of green, sustainable synthetic routes for pharmaceuticals. By bridging organic chemistry with biology, I contribute to advancing innovative solutions in therapeutic development across various diseases that pose threat to human existence.</p>

<h2>Future Research Directions</h2>

 Development of Novel Anticancer Therapies Using DNA, Nucleotides, and Nucleosides

Cancer remains a global health challenge, driving the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. As a researcher in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery, my future work will focus on leveraging the unique biochemical properties of DNA, nucleotides, and nucleosides to develop next-generation anticancer drugs. This approach combines the precision of targeted therapy with the potential to modulate molecular pathways critical to tumor progression.

<p><b>1. DNA-Based Therapies</b></p>

DNA-based therapeutics offer an exciting avenue for cancer treatment, capitalizing on the ability to selectively target genetic abnormalities driving malignancies. My future research will aim to:

Design synthetic oligonucleotides and aptamers to interfere with oncogene expression or modulate tumor suppressor pathways.

Explore DNA damage-based strategies, such as targeted delivery of DNA-cleaving agents or enhancing the efficacy of existing DNA-damaging drugs through synthetic modifications.

Investigate CRISPR/Cas-based approaches to directly correct mutations in oncogenes or inactivate driver genes.


<p><b>2. Nucleotide Analogues</b></p>

Nucleotide analogues have a proven track record as chemotherapeutic agents, such as cytarabine and gemcitabine. Building on this success, I plan to:

Develop novel nucleotide analogues with enhanced selectivity for cancer cell DNA polymerases or kinases involved in replication stress.

Engineer prodrug forms of nucleotides with improved pharmacokinetics and bioavailability for targeted delivery to tumor sites.

Combine nucleotide analogues with inhibitors of DNA repair pathways, such as PARP, to exploit tumor-specific vulnerabilities.


<p><b>3. Nucleoside-Based Strategies</b></p>

Nucleosides, as natural building blocks of DNA and RNA, provide a foundation for innovative drug design. My research will emphasize:

Developing nucleoside analogues that interfere with cancer cell metabolism, such as inhibition of nucleotide biosynthesis pathways.

Investigating immune-modulatory properties of nucleosides to boost anti-tumor immune responses in combination therapies.

Enhancing stability and targeting of nucleoside-based drugs using novel delivery systems, such as nanoparticles or antibody-drug conjugates.


<p><b>4. Integration with Emerging Technologies</b></p>

In the pursuit of more effective treatments, my research will incorporate cutting-edge technologies, including:

High-throughput screening and AI-driven molecular modeling to identify promising DNA, nucleotide, and nucleoside analogues.

Advanced delivery platforms, such as liposomal carriers, to improve drug specificity and minimize off-target effects.

Collaborative efforts to explore synergistic combinations of these agents with existing chemotherapies, immunotherapies, or radiotherapies.


<p><b>5. Addressing Challenges and Future Perspectives</b></p>

While the therapeutic potential of DNA, nucleotide, and nucleoside-based drugs is immense, challenges remain in optimizing their stability, specificity, and delivery. My future research will focus on overcoming these obstacles by integrating chemical modifications, novel biomaterials, and innovative formulations to maximize clinical efficacy and safety.

By harnessing the potential of these biomolecular approaches, I aim to contribute to the development of anticancer drugs that not only prolong survival but also improve the quality of life for patients. This vision aligns with the broader goal of advancing precision oncology and fostering innovation in cancer therapeutics.</p>
